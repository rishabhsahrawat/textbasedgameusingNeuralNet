# textbasedgameusingNeuralNetandReinforcementLearning
This project is based on paper "Language understanding for text based games Using Deep Reinforcement Learning" by Karthik, Regina, Tejas. Here is the link for the paper- https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08941v2.pdf
The Game is called "Home World" consisiting of 4 rooms.
For playing the player recieves a text description about the rooms and a questgame. A quest is something like 'you are not sleepy but hungry'.Text description is also known as 'state'.
